Steps to building assembly (Windows):

1) Download NASM from here: http://www.octium.net/nasm/?page=download 
2) Put nasmw.exe (from step #1) in the MACLib\Assembly directory
3) Edit MACLib\Assembly\Compile.bat to use the correct path in the first line (should point to your MACLib\Assembly directory)
4) Running Compile.bat will now create the necessary .obj file(s)
